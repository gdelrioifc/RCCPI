<h2>Supplementary material for "Residue Cluster Classes Efficiently Identify Protein Interfaces and Interactions"</h2>

This site contains the <a href="https://github.com/gdelrioifc/RCCPI/tree/main/Train">training</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gdelrioifc/RCCPI/tree/main/Test">testing</a> datasets used to evaluate Residue Cluster Classes (RCC) vectors in classifying true and flase protein-peptide interactions (PpI). To do so, the RCC vector for each pair of peptide and protein three-dimensional structures was derived as previosuly reported <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33286246/">(Fontove F and Del Rio G, 2020)</a>, and the vectors were summed or concatenated to generate a single vector to represent a PpI. Twentyfour datasets were used to generate twentyfour Weka models that are available at the <a href="">Models</a> directory.

Four of these models were used to further test the generalization of these models by testing the ability to identify the interface of known protein-protein interaction (PPI) complexes reported in the <a href="">3DID database</a>. The list of PPI used in this study is available at the <a href="">3DID</a> directory. The <a href="">CodesRCCPI</a> directory contain the Java codes used to generate the peptides from an interacting protein A, that are likely to predict with protein B, as well as the instructions to compile and execute. To validate those predictions, we used the <a href="">3did_flat.tsv</a> file provided by the 3DID database and we also generated a code to identify the closest peptides derived from protein A to protein B. These codes are available at the <a href="">CodesCP</a> directory.
