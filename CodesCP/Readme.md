# CodesCP
<h2>This directory contains the Java codes required to identify the closests peptides derived from one protein interacting with another.</h2>

<p>After downlofing these files, compile them by typing in your terminal:</p>

<p>javac PrPrInterfacePredictorBFDistanceFromFile.java</p>

<p>That command line will generate .class files in your directory. In some Java compilers you may get an warning message:</p>

<p>./GetMinimumDistance.java:42: warning: [removal] Double(double) in Double has been deprecated and marked for removal</p>

<p>Please ignore it.</p>

<p>You may execute the Java programm by typing in your terminal:</p>

<p>java PrPrInterfacePredictorBFDistanceFromFile</p>

<p>That will print out the instructions to use the program to calculate the closest peptides for a given PDB ID that includes a protein-protein complex.</p>
